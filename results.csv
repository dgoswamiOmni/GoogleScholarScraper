Background
	I am a researcher, teacher and data scientist who works in computational social science and environmental data science with a special interest in areas where the social and environmental overlap. My background is in Theoretical Physics, I completed a BA in Computational Physics in Trinity College Dublin (2008) and a PhD in Particle Physics at the University of Edinburgh (2012). Since then I've worked in academia and industry in areas as diverse as: speculative theories of fundamental physics; genetics; algorithm design; software engineering; social media analysis; applied and theoretical ecology. I started work at the University of Exeter in 2017 as a researcher and became a lecturer in 2019. My current research focuses mainly on environmental challenges - specifically on computational methods to understand and harness “big data” from social media, satellites and other sources to help with the ongoing climate emergency. Long term, my goal is to realise the promise of big data for addressing environmental issues while mitigating the problems of bias, privacy, access, rigour and effective research translation.

	Hi!
	I am a Senior Lecturer in data science in the department of computer science at the University of Exeter, and I am also a 
fellow at the Alan Turing Institute
. My research aims to provide a 
deeper understanding of human behaviour
, both at the collective and individual level, by using novel data streams. Large data sets are constantly being generated thanks to our interactions with large technological systems, such as the Internet and the mobile phone network, or they can be collected through our usage of smart phone apps and tracking sensors. I use tools from data science, network theory, behavioural and computational social sciences to analyse these data sets and investigate different aspects of human behaviour.
	Recently, I have also been working on a number of projects related to how we can study the 
cost, accessibility and performance of public transport in the UK
. I am broadly interested in how we can use better data and data science methods to improve our transport systems, and support policy makers design better transport policies.
	I regularly 
collaborate with a number of policy makers
, and I am particularly passionate about 
how data, data science and AI can be used to support the policy making process
.
	I am an academic editor for 
PLOS ONE
 and I act as a reviewer for several international journals.
	I was also a co-founder and organiser of 
Databeers Warwick
, an informal networking event for all those interested in data stories.
	I am offering to supervise self-funded PhD students in the areas of:
	- computational social science and data science, in particular to study human behaviour using new forms of data (such as social media or mobile phone data)
	- urban systems
	- behavioural data science
	- data science for public policy

	Hi, I'm Chico!
	I am a Lecturer in Computer Science at the University of Exeter, a research associate at the 
Oxford Internet Institute
, University of Oxford, member of the Council of the 
Complex Systems Society
, Computational Social Science theme lead at the 
Institute for Data Science and AI
, and the director of the 
CC Lab
.
	Research
	My research concerns the 
evolution of information
.
	To be more specific: we develop new computational tools to study the media we produce and consume, the beliefs we hold and stories we tell, our myths and traditions, as well as the opinions, ideas, and narratives we propagate – how they develop, and how they evolve.
	In doing so, I combine tools and approaches from data science, mathematical modelling, complex systems, algorithmic information theory, evolutionary biology, cultural evolution, cultural sociology, political communication, social psychology, cognitive psychology, and broadly speaking, computational social science.
	For more detail and examples of ongoing projects, see the 
CC Lab website

Research interests
	Machine learning for intelligent image and video understanding.   Bayesian modelling and variational approximation.   Sea wave prediction and quiescent period prediction.   Maritime applications of Bayesian modelling and simulation.
	 
 
Current projects
 
Sea Wave Prediction
	Working with 
Prof. Michael Belmont
, Hon. Prof. Dr Bernard Ferrier and Dr Mustafa (Fass) Al-Ani to make significant improvements to the safety of maritime launch and recovery operations by providing short-term predictions of the profiles of the waves. We are pioneering research into Quiescent Period Prediction (QPP) which aims to predict when short periods of relative calm are about to occur. This has the potential to allow a range of wave critical marine operations to be safely carried out at considerably larger wave amplitudes than would otherwise be possible. Our work has been funded by the EPSRC (ref 
EP/N009142/1
) and we are currently working directly with the Royal Navy and MOD.
	PhD student 
Antonis Loizou
 has recently passed his PhD viva, subject to minor corrections, working on methods for measuring the sea surface from radar and video.
 
Multi-Light Imaging
	Together with PhD student 
Matthew McGuigan
 and the Metropolitan Police, we are working on a multi-light imaging method for extracting images of latent fingerprints from difficult surfaces, such as lighbulbs. The new technique is described in 
""Remote Extraction of Latent Fingerprints (RELF)""
, which demonstrates how good the results are. RELF is fully automated, contactless and chemical-free, meaning that the original latent prints remain available for other forms of forensic analysis.
	Matthew and I are also working on a method for enabling Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI) to be carried out on specular surfaces.
 
 
Real-time Bayesian inference for non-stationary systems
	Noisy sensors may be in situ for a considerable (possibly effectively infinite) period of time, and the system they are sensing may be statistically non-stationary. In 
""Non-stationary, online variational Bayesian learning, with circular variables""
 I introduce a means of continuously learning from such time-series streams, potentially in real time.
 
Projects in the pipeline
	I have further projects in the pipeline, with partners in: Babcock and BMT; QinetiQ; the Royal Navy and MOD; the Metropolitan Police; and the Austrian Institute of Technology and a number of police and forensic institutes across Europe.

	Fabrizio received his PhD in Computer Science from the University of Firenze, Italy. Before joining Exeter University as a Lecturer in Data Analytics (2017), he worked as a Research Assistant at the Universita' degli Studi di Firenze, Italy, at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium and at the Albert Ludwig University of Freiburg, Germany.
	 
 
Reserach interests:
	At high level my main research question is: how can we integrate domain expert knowledge at the right abstraction level into machine learning (ML) systems and how can we extract knowledge from these systems at various abstraction levels.
	In particular I have been interested in: 1) generalizing the type of information that ML algorithms can process and 2) extending the type of problems that ML can address.
	1) The study of input generalization for ML algorithms has lead to the development of efficient and flexible graph kernels and feature generators for graphs (see the 
EDeN
 library) with applications in relational learning and chemo- and bioinformatics domains.
	2) The study of generalizing ML tasks has lead to the notion of data driven design or 
Constructive Machine Learning
 (CML) (see the 
CML workshops
). The objective of CML is the design of algorithms that can build novel objects endowed with desired properties. Such algorithms have a wide spectrum of applications, ranging from drug and protein design to automatic software generation, from music composition to video game assets construction.

	About Me:
Starting out as a reseach meteorologist I moved into Data Science in 2016. After a couple of stints in industry working for start-ups, I returned to academia to do a postdoc at the University of Exeter. Working with Hywel Williams I looked at how we can use ""social sensing"" to determine hayfever levels in the UK using twitter as a proxy for pollen observations. Around this time I also trained as a counsellor and began working part-time in the NHS. Now I combine these skills and experience to support Degree Apprenticeship students on the Level 7 Research  Scientist/ MSc Data Science as an Academic Mentor/Lecturer.

Background
 
	I am a lecturer in Computer Science in University of Exeter.
	I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Kent. My thesis addressed stream learning using ant colony optimization approach, under the supervision of Dr.  Fernando Otero and Prof. Alex Freitas.
	My Ph.D. topic was around applying new pheromone model into current existing ACO inspired approaches in data mining. Namely, adding new pheromone model for the classification and regression approaches in Ant Miner. I extended the Ant Miner algorithm, and created a novel stream mining Ant Miner algorithm.
	I possess key skills in machine learning methods, statistics, and programming (including  Java, C++ and python).
	I hold an MSc in Computer Science (with Honors) from the American University in Cairo, with dissertation focusing on optimisation algorithms to solve QAP problems.

	My research focus is on human-AI collaboration and in how the next generation of artificial intelligence technologies can be engineered so as to work with people. I want to understand how building machines to support collaborative human decision making can contribute to progress on real-world human decision making problems.
 
	My work has previously contributed to the idea that human behaviour can  be predicted with computer models that assume people will behave optimally given limits on the mind's processing capacitites. In contrast, the commonly held view that people are 'irrational' has now been shown to be false in many decision settings. Instead people appear to do the best that they can with the knowledge and processing capacities that are available. It follows that adopting a view of humans as bounded optimal provides a firm scientific basis for artificial intelligence systems that  infer human preferences from behaviour.

	Dr. Avon Huxor
	I am an Associate Lecturer working on the MSc Data Science (Professional).
	Background
	My background is diverse. After a degree in Architecture and Planning, I obtained an MA(RCA) from the Royal College of Art in Design Theory, and which led me into the field of Artificial Intelligence. After some years researching AI at ECRC in Munich, I returned to the UK to undertake a PhD in the subject, in which I argued it is better understood as a medium for the communication of knowledge between people.
	In 2000, partly as a consequence of the AI winter, I started to re-skill in an old passion of mine - astronomy. After an MSc and PhD in astrophysics from the Univesrity of Hertfordshire I spent many years as a research (observational) astronomer at the Universities of Bristol, Edinbirgh and, latterly, Heidelberg.
	In 2015, I moved back to the UK, and into Data Science and Machine Learning, with an MSc in these subjects from the University of Bristol. I remained at Bristol for a few years as a research associate and data scientist working on medical texts, before moving to Exeter in August of 2020.
	Details can be found on my 
ORCID site
.
	Research Interests
	My research continues the themes flund in my prior work. They are:
 
		Application of machine learning to astronomical data. Specifically, detecting star clusters in image data, and identifiying rare astrophysical objects (e.g. carbon stars) in large catalogue datasets.
 
		Extending the work in my first PhD on the knowledge medium, in which we can usefully reinterpret AI/ML work in terms of a computational surface that allows humans to communicate knowledge to each other.
 
		I also have an interest in innovation studies; can we use data to identify possible innovation in science and technology 
avant la lettre

	Research
	My current research interests lie in the
 novel data science methods for remote sensing data acquisition and processing (machine learning, autonomous vehicles). 
These scientific investigations have real-world applications in areas such as natural disaster relief and marine observation. Examples include the detection of algal blooms, tracking of marine carbon flux, and detection of marine oil spills, among others. My work greatly benefits from collaborative research with leading research institutes, including the Plymouth Marine Laboratory, the Met Office, and the National Oceanographic Centre.

	Short Bio
	My name is Diogo F. Pacheco, and I am passionate about data; by its capacity to inform and to mislead. I am particularly interested in computational social science and modeling complex social behavior, i.e. combining the expertise of social, cognitive, and STEM scientists to develop tools to enhance our understanding about society.
 
	I started my academic life at the University of Pernambuco (Recife-PE, Brazil) aiming to use computational intelligence to solve practical real world problems. My bachelors and masters in Computer Engineering main contribution was building a decision support system (DSS) for the sugarcane harvest problem. The DSS was empowered by an evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithm processing leveraged information from artificial neural networks.
 
	In 2013, after a 5-year break from Academia working in the Industry, I moved to the USA to start my Ph.D. focusing on the exploration of social media data (the digital footprints) as a proxy for understanding human behavior, at the Florida Institute of Technology. In 2018, I joined (and still affiliated) the 
Observatory on Social Media
 and 
Center for Complex Networks and Systems Research
 at Indiana University as a postdoctoral fellow. We focused our research in the misinformation arena, trying to understand the biases making us vulnerable to it, and detecting coordinated groups exploiting social media platforms.
